# WIDS37_PROJECT
Week 1 – Data Loading and Initial Exploration
The first week is focused on getting familiar with the dataset and building a base pipeline.
Main steps covered:
Importing required Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib
Uploading and loading the dataset directly into the notebook
Inspecting the dataset structure (columns, data types, shape)
Checking for missing values and obvious inconsistencies
Performing basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Visualizing simple patterns and distributions where required
This notebook mainly helps in understanding what the data looks like and what kind of preprocessing will be needed later.

Week 2 – Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The second week builds on the first by refining the dataset and preparing it for further analytical or modeling tasks.
Main steps covered:
Reloading the dataset in a structured way
Handling missing or inconsistent values
Cleaning and transforming relevant columns
Feature-level inspection to understand usefulness and impact
Removing unnecessary or redundant data where applicable
Preparing a cleaner version of the dataset for downstream tasks
By the end of Week 2, the data is in a much more usable and reliable form compared to the raw input.
